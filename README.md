# hello-world
Hi, world!

I'm Reuben, from Singapore! 
I'm a Product Engineer currently at JMS Singapore Pte Ltd, and I'm interested in learning more about software, IT, computer science, and mathematics!

I like to run, but I'm suffering from an injury, and also don't have much time to run, nowadays, sadly.
